# DataDrive2030-Early-Learning-Predictors-Challenge
This was a challenge hosted on the zindi platform.
The objective of the challenge was to use  machine learning techniques to identify which early learning programme factors contribute to better learning outcomes in children by predicting a child's ELOM score (Early Learning Outcomes Measure).
The evaluation metric was the root mean square error.
